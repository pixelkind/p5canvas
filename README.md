# p5canvas

The p5canvas extensions allows you to preview your p5js code in a canvas side by side with your code. The canvas refreshes live, while editing.

![Example Screenshot](images/example_01.png)

There is a standard setup script included which setups a full width/height canvas that will be resized automatically. In one of the next versions this will become optional.

## Features

- Side Preview while editing the JavaScript file
- JSHint integration to find errors

## Usage

If a JavaScript file is open, a p5canvas button appears in the status bar bottom left. Click on it, to open the preview.
